### Overview:
Web chat application where users can share text messages in chatrooms that instantly display to all users in the chatroom. Users can create their own channels, and set their own display names. They can also customize their chat and messages with colors and styles.
  
## Personal Touch:
Customize chatroom styles: The user can change the default color of the text in the chatroom and can color the usernames associated with the messages. Also, the user can style their messages in a way that displays to all users in the chatroom.
